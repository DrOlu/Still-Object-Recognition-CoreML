[MakeML](https://makeml.app?from=github_still_image_object_detection) is a Developer Tool for Creating Object Detection and Segmentation Neural Networks without a Line of Code. It's built to make the training process easy to setup. It is designed to handle data sets, training configurations, markup and training processes â€” all in one place.

## Still Object Recognition Example with CoreML
Is an iOS project example that can be used to run your own CoreML Object Detection Model, which detects objects on still images.

## Train Custom Object Recognition CoreML model

With MakeML you can prepare dataset and train CoreML model with Tensorflow or Turi Create frameworks in one application.

See the [Tutorial](https://makeml.app/docs/doc1?from=github_still_image_object_detection) for the training object detection model without a line of code with macOS desktop application.

For using this project with another .mlmodel file, add it to the project and change this line with your name of the model.
```
guard let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "ObjectDetector", withExtension: "mlmodelc") else {
    return
}
```
